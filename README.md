# Java_Task_2
### This is my second Java task with StartNG
* The activity does not have the default Title bar and the screen has **four divisions**.
* The top division contains Nigeriaâ€™s flag, git, starNG icon and my photo that are evenly spaced using ImageViews.
* The second division displays my __name__, **slack Id** and **email** in TextViews.
* The third division contains a **scrollable list** of my likes, dislikes and hobbies.
* The bottom division contains 3 evenly spaced random icons.
* This is the output of the task. ![Output](/likes.png)
